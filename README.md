# Hand Scroll

I read a lot of web pages, documents, papers and files. While I read them, I leave the mouse and keyboard and grab my chin in order to focus.
So I thought, why not make a hand scroll to make it easier to read and scroll the page?

Here it is. It's using ML5 for hand tracking and p5.js for the visualisation and Electron for the desktop app with robotjs for the scrolling.

### How to run 

Just `npm install`
and then `npm start`

### How should you use it effectively?

Just change a few lines of code and hide the browser window permanently. So it will get hidden and you can use the hand scroll without any distraction.

Also you can launch it on startup.
